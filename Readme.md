# Requirements 

Simple user stories which 
need to be implemented by the AUV monitoring application 

 - [ ] As a user I want to use simple AUV sensors monitoring application so I can check the 
temperature and pressure readings while the AUV is in operation. 
 
- [ ] As a user I want to see a list of AUV sensors so I can monitor the temperature and pressure 
readings from all sensors installed on the AUV. 

- [ ] As a user I want to see information from all AUV sensors in unified units so that I can directly 
compare the difference of all the readings on one screen. 

- [ ] As a user I want to be able to select which unit the temperature and pressure readings from 
the sensors are displayed in so that I don’t have to convert the values. 

- [ ] As a user I want an automatic update of the temperature and pressure readings on the screen 
every second so that I can see the latest values provided by the sensors all the time. 

- [ ] As a user I want the application to be robust so when the error in sensor reading happens the 
application do not crash.
